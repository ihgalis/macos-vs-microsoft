# macos-vs-microsoft
For everyone who has problems with Microsoft's Office software on a mac.

# Install

## Download code

```
git clone https://github.com/ihgalis/macos-vs-microsoft.git
```

## Switch directory

```
cd macos-vs-microsoft
```

## Make it runnable

```
chmod +x reset-teams-on-mac.sh
```

## Start it

```
./reset-teams-on-mac.sh
```

Now you can start Microsoft Teams again and hope it doesn' behave like it did before. You need to login again now.
